The Odin Project, HTML Recipes Project

Before starting the project: I will be able to demonstrate my capability in using HTML tags, elements, and attributes to create a simple "brutalist" website that covers some recipes.

After completing the project: this was fun! I have never used Git/Github so much before, but it is definitely useful now that I've learned it. Hope you guys enjoy the recipes I drafted up, they're some of my favorites!
