    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A quick, easy, and refreshing way to accompany your bandeja paisa is the Brazilian
        lemonade. We know lemonade to be made with water, lemons, and sugar, right? Well, 
        this version uses limes and adds some condensed milk in the mix, making the drink 
        a bit more thick and milky, essentially making it something similar to a milkshake. 
        Give it a try:
